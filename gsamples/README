To install gsample, you need to first download/compile two software packages, 
Samtools and Boost, setup the corresponding environmental variables, and then
compile the source code of gsample.

1, Download Samtools from {http://www.htslib.org/} with version 1.2 or higher.
Compile it to generate the htslib file libhts.a. Set environment variable
HTSLIB to indicate the directory of libhts.a.  For example, for Unix platforms,
add the following statement to the file ~/.bash_profile:

	export HTSLIB="/directory/to/your/htslib/htslib-1.2.1"

2, Download Boost from {http://www.boost.org}. Uncompress it
somewhere~(compiling and installing are not necessary). Set environment
variable BOOST_HOME to indicate the directory of Boost.  For example, for Unix
platforms, add the following statement to the file ~/.bash_profile:

	export BOOST_HOME="/directory/to/your/boost/boost_1_60_0"

3, Execute the following commands to generate Makefile and compile:\\

	cd src
	aclocal
	autoconf
	autoheader
	automake -a
	./configure
	make

The executable file gsamples will be present at src.
